# Reviews Declined

Question: What reviews of code changes ended up declining the change during a certain period?


## Description

Reviews are defined as in [Reviews](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/metrics/Reviews.md).
Declined reviews are those that are finally closed without
being merged into the code base of the project.

For example, in GitHub when a pull request is closed without
merging, and the commits referenced in it cannot be found
in the git repository, it can be considered to be declined
(but see detailed discussion below). The same can be said of
GitLab merge requests. In the case of Gerrit, code reviews
can be formally "abandoned", which is the way of detecting
declined reviews in this system.


## Objectives

* Volume of coding activity.
    Declined code reviews are a proxy for the activity in a project.
    By counting declined code reviews in the set of repositories corresponding
    to a project, you can have an idea of the overall coding activity in
    that project that did not lead to actual changes.
    Of course, this metric is not the only one that should be
    used to track volume of coding activity.



## Implementation

**Aggregators**:
* Count. Total number of declined reviews during the period.
* Ratio. Ratio of declined reviews over the total number of reviews during that pariod.

**Parameters:**
* Period of time. Start and finish date of the period during which declined reviews are considered. Default: forever.
* Criteria for source code. Algorithm. Default: all files are source code.  
    If we focus on source code, we need a criterion to decide
    whether a file belongs to the source code or not.


### Filters 

* By actors (submitter, reviewer, merger). Requires merging identities corresponding to the same actor.
* By groups of actors (employer, gender... for each of the actors).
Requires actor grouping, and likely, actor merging.


### Visualizations 

* Count per period over time
* Ratio per period over time

These could be grouped (per actor type, or per group of actors) by applying the filters,
and could be represented as bar charts, with time running in the X axis.
Each bar would represent declined reviews during a certain period (eg, a month).


### Data Collection Strategies 

**Specific description: GitHub**

In the case of GitHub, accepted reviews are defined as "pull requests
that are closed with their changes not being included in the git repository",
as long as it proposes changes to source code files.

See the discussion in the specific description for GitHub in
[Reviews Accepted](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/metrics/Reviews_Accepted.md), since it applies here as well.

Mandatory parameters (for GitHub):

* Heuristic for detecting declined pull requests, telling apart
  those cases where the pull request was closed, but the
  changes were included in the git repository manually.
  Default: None.

**Specific description: GitLab**

In the case of GitLab, declined reviews are defined as "merge requests
that are closed with their changes not being included in the git repository",
as long as it proposes changes to source code files.

Mandatory parameters (for GitLab):

* Heuristic for detecting declined merge requests, telling apart
  those cases where the merge request was closed, but the
  changes were included in the git repository manually. Default: None.

**Specific description: Gerrit**

In the case of Gerrit, declined reviews are defined as "changesets
abandoned", as long as they propose changes to source code files.

Mandatory parameters (for Gerrit): None.
